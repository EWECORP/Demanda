    "## 2) Modelo de Regresi√≥n Lineal con Variables Temporales (RLVT)\n",
    "En este enfoque, se usa regresi√≥n lineal m√∫ltiple para estimar la demanda futura en funci√≥n de variables de ventas pasadas:\n",
    "\n",
    "### F√≥rmula General:\n",
    "$Dt=Œ≤0 +Œ≤1 ‚ãÖVt +Œ≤2 ‚ãÖVt‚àí1 +Œ≤3‚ãÖVt‚àí12 +œµ $\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Donde:\n",
    "* Dt = Demanda estimada del mes actual.\n",
    "* ùëâùë° = Ventas del mes en curso.\n",
    "* ùëâùë°‚àí1 = Ventas del mes anterior.\n",
    "* ùëâùë°‚àí12 = Ventas del mismo mes del a√±o anterior.\n",
    "* Œ≤0,Œ≤1,Œ≤2,Œ≤3 = Pesos asignados a cada variable, definidos con base en la importancia de cada factor.\n",
    "* œµ = Factor ofertas\n",

    "* **Mes en curso (t)** ‚Üí Refleja la demanda actual.\n",
    "* **Mes anterior (t-1)** ‚Üí Captura tendencias recientes.\n",
    "* **Mismo mes del a√±o anterior (t-12)** ‚Üí Captura estacionalidad.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ventajas:\n",
    "* ‚úÖ Permite agregar m√°s factores (promociones, precios, d√≠as festivos, eventos externos).\n",
    "* ‚úÖ Se puede optimizar con t√©cnicas de Machine Learning para encontrar los mejores coeficientes.\n",
    "* ‚úÖ No requiere supuestos estrictos sobre estacionalidad.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Desventajas:\n",
    "* ‚ùå Supone relaciones lineales entre ventas pasadas y futuras (puede ser inexacto en mercados vol√°tiles).\n"
